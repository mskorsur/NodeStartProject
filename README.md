# Node Starting Program


 
 A simple program which utilizies Node.js platform with Express framework,
 Mongo database and Handlebars templating engine.
 
 This project was created in order to familiarise myself with all of the 
 technologies listed above.

 Short description: Modeled data represents a student entry with all of the associate information.
 We can either pull down data form the server which will list all of the current students in the database
 or we can fill out a simple form and save a new entry in the database.

  Ready to be used as a starting point for a university's project / bachelor's thesis.

 UPDATE: Decided to switch from Jade templating engine to Handlebars. Its resemblance to native HTML
 makes it more appealing and easier to use whilst its capabilities are equal to the ones in Jade.
 Every view was conveniently changed from Jade's syntax Handlebars', but its content stayed the same.
