# Node Starting Program


 
 A simple program which utilizies Node.js platform with Express framework,
 Mongo database and Handlebars templating engine.
 
 This project was created in order to familiarise myself with all of the 
 technologies listed above.

 Short description: Modeled data represents a student entry with all of the associate information.
 We can either pull down data form the server which will list all of the current students in the database
 or we can fill out a simple form and save a new entry in the database.

 Ready to be used as a starting point for a university's project / bachelor's thesis.

 ------------
 UPDATE: Decided to switch from Jade templating engine to Handlebars. The reason for this was
 mainly because Handlebars' views closely resemble native HTML which, in turn, makes it more simple
 and natural to work with. Along with block, helpers and partials I think it provides far more 
 option and choices.
